Bleeding is understood as a situation when blood (normally located inside the vessels of the human body) for various reasons (most often as a result of injury) leaves the vascular bed, which leads to acute blood loss - the irretrievable loss of part of the blood. This is accompanied by a decrease in the function of the circulatory system for the transfer of oxygen and nutrients to the organs, which is accompanied by a deterioration or cessation of their activity. insignificant before the termination of life, i.e. death of the victim. This can happen when large vessels are damaged when first aid is not provided, i.e. with uncontrolled heavy bleeding. The compensatory capabilities of the human body, as a rule, are sufficient to maintain life with bleeding of low and moderate intensity, when the rate of blood loss is low. In the case of damage to large vessels, the rate of blood loss can be so significant that the death of the victim without first aid can occur within a few minutes from the moment of injury.

<b>The purpose and procedure for performing a general examination of the victim</b>
The purpose of the survey is to determine the signs of bleeding that needs to be stopped as soon as possible. A general inspection is carried out very quickly, within 1-2 seconds, from head to toe.
  
<b>The main signs of acute blood loss:</b>
Sharp general weakness; feeling of thirst; dizziness; flashing "flies" before the eyes; fainting, more often when trying to get up; pale, moist and cold skin; cardiopalmus; frequent breathing.
These signs can be observed both in the presence of ongoing external bleeding, and with stopped bleeding, as well as in the absence of visible or ongoing bleeding.
  
<b>External bleeding</b>
Accompanied by damage to the skin and mucous membranes, while the blood is poured out into the environment.
  
<b>Arterial bleeding</b>
They are the most dangerous, since when large arteries are injured, a large loss of blood occurs in a short time. A sign of arterial bleeding is usually a pulsating scarlet stream of blood, a quickly spreading pool of scarlet blood, and the victim’s clothes quickly soaked in blood.
  
<b>Venous bleeding</b>
They are characterized by a lower rate of blood loss, the blood is dark cherry, it flows out in a “brook”. Venous bleeding may be less dangerous than arterial bleeding, but it also needs to be stopped as soon as possible.
  
<b>Capillary bleeding</b>
Observed with abrasions, cuts, scratches. Capillary bleeding usually does not pose a direct threat to life.
  
<b>Mixed bleeding</b>
These are bleedings at which there are at the same time arterial, venous and capillary bleeding. They are observed, for example, when a limb is torn off. Dangerous due to the presence of arterial bleeding.
  
<b>Currently, when providing first aid, the following methods of temporarily stopping bleeding are used:</b>
1. Direct pressure on the wound.
2. Applying a pressure bandage.
3. Finger pressure of the artery.
4. Maximum flexion of the limb in the joint.
5. Applying a hemostatic tourniquet (standard or impromptu).

<b>Direct pressure on the wound</b>
It is the easiest way to stop bleeding. When using it, the wound is closed with sterile wipes or a sterile bandage, after which pressure is applied to the wound area by the hand of the first aid participant with sufficient force to stop the bleeding. In the absence of a bandage or napkins, any tissue at hand can be used to apply to the wound. In the absence of personal and improvised means, it is permissible to apply pressure on the wound with the hand of a first aid participant (while not forgetting the need to use medical gloves).
The victim can also be advised to try to stop the bleeding he has by himself, using direct pressure on the wound.
  
<b>Compression bandage</b>
A pressure bandage can be used to stop bleeding for longer. When applying it, you should follow the general principles of applying bandage dressings: it is advisable to put sterile wipes from the first-aid kit on the wound, the bandage should be rolled out in the direction of travel, at the end of the application, the bandage should be fixed by tying the free end of the bandage around the limb. Since the main task of the bandage is to stop bleeding, it must be applied with force (pressure). If the bandage begins to soak with blood, then a few more sterile napkins are applied over it and bandaged tightly.
  
<b>Finger pressing of the artery</b>
allows you to quickly and effectively stop bleeding from large arteries. Pressure is applied at certain points between the wound and the heart. The choice of points is due to the possibility of pressing the artery to the bone. The result is a cessation of blood flow to the damaged area of the vessel and a stop or a significant weakening of bleeding. As a rule, digital pressure on the artery precedes the application of a tourniquet and is used in the first seconds after the detection of bleeding and the start of first aid (as well as direct pressure on the wound). Finger pressure on the artery can be either an independent way to stop bleeding, or used in combination with other methods (for example, with a pressure bandage on a wound). The effectiveness and correctness of using this method is determined visually - by reducing or stopping bleeding.
  
<b>Compressing the common carotid artery</b>
The common carotid artery is pressed on the anterior surface of the neck outside of the larynx on the side of the injury. Pressure at the indicated point can be carried out with four fingers simultaneously towards the spine, while the carotid artery is pressed against it. Another option for digital carotid pressure is to press the same point with the thumb towards the spine. It is necessary to press with sufficient force, because. bleeding from the carotid artery is very intense.
  
<b>Compression of the subclavian artery</b>
The subclavian artery is pressed in the fossa above the clavicle to the first rib. You can apply pressure to the pressure point of the subclavian artery using four straightened fingers. Another way to digitally press the subclavian artery is to press with flexed fingers.
  
<b>Compression of the brachial artery</b>
The brachial artery is pressed against the humerus from the inside between the biceps and triceps in the middle third of the shoulder, if the bleeding arose from wounds in the middle and lower thirds of the shoulder, forearm and hand. Pressure on the pressure point is carried out with the help of four fingers of the hand, clasping the shoulder of the victim from above or below.
 
<b>Compression of the axillary artery</b>
The axillary artery presses against the humerus in the armpit when bleeding from a shoulder wound below the shoulder joint. Pressure on the pressure point of the axillary artery is made with straight, rigidly fixed fingers with sufficient force in the direction of the shoulder joint. In this case, the area of the shoulder joint of the victim should be held with the other hand.
  
<b>Compression of the femoral artery</b>
The femoral artery is pressed below the inguinal fold when bleeding from wounds in the thigh. Pressure is applied with a fist fixed with the second hand, the weight of the first aid participant's body.
  
<b>Maximum limb flexion at the joint</b>
Maximum flexion of the limb in the joint leads to bending and compression of the blood vessel, which contributes to the cessation of bleeding. This method is quite effective in stopping bleeding. To increase efficiency, 1-2 bandages or rolled-up clothing should be placed in the joint area. After bending, the limb is fixed with hands, several rounds of a bandage or improvised means (for example, a trouser belt).

<b>Bleeding from wounds of the upper part of the shoulder and subclavian region</b>
In case of bleeding from wounds of the upper part of the shoulder and the subclavian region, the upper limb is brought behind the back with flexion at the elbow joint and fixed with a bandage, or both hands are brought back with flexion at the elbow joints and pulled to each other with a bandage.
  
<b>Stop bleeding from the forearm</b>
To stop bleeding from the forearm, a roller is inserted into the elbow bend, the limb is bent as much as possible at the elbow joint and the forearm is fixed to the shoulder in this position, for example, with a belt.
  
<b>Injury to the vessels of the foot, lower leg and popliteal fossa</b>
In case of damage to the vessels of the foot, lower leg and popliteal fossa, several bandages or a tissue roller are inserted into the latter, after which the limb is bent at the knee joint and fixed in this position with a bandage.
  
<b>Stopping bleeding in a hip injury</b>
To stop bleeding in case of a hip injury, a bundle of tissue or several bandages is inserted into the inguinal fold area, the lower limb is bent at the hip joint (the knee is pulled to the chest) and fixed with hands or a bandage.

<b>Application of a hemostatic tourniquet</b>
A tourniquet may be used to temporarily stop severe arterial bleeding for a longer period of time. To reduce the negative impact of the tourniquet on the limbs, it should be applied in accordance with the following rules.
  
<b>Application of a hemostatic tourniquet</b>
A tourniquet may be used to temporarily stop severe arterial bleeding for a longer period of time.

<b>To reduce the negative impact of the tourniquet on the limbs, it should be applied in accordance with the following rules.</b>
one). A tourniquet should be applied only for arterial bleeding in case of injury to the shoulder and thigh.
2). The tourniquet must be applied between the wound and the heart, as close as possible to the wound. If the place of application of the tourniquet falls on the middle third of the shoulder and on the lower third of the thigh, the tourniquet should be applied higher.
3). A tourniquet cannot be applied to a naked body, only over clothing or a fabric (bandage) pad.
four). Before applying, the tourniquet should be wound behind the limb and stretched.
5). Bleeding is stopped by the first (stretched) round of the tourniquet, all subsequent (fixing) rounds are superimposed so that each subsequent round overlaps the previous one by about half.
6). The tourniquet should not be covered with a bandage or clothing, i.e. should be visible.
7). The exact time of applying the tourniquet should be indicated in the note, the note should be placed under the tourniquet
eight). The maximum time the tourniquet is on the limb should not exceed 60 minutes in the warm season and 30 minutes in the cold.
9). After applying the tourniquet, the limb should be immobilized (immobilized) and thermally insulated (wrapped) using available methods.
ten). If the maximum tourniquet time has expired and medical attention is not available, the following should be done:
a) carry out digital pressure of the artery above the tourniquet;
b) remove the tourniquet for 15 minutes;
c) if possible, perform a light massage of the limb on which the tourniquet was applied;
d) apply a tourniquet just above the previous place of application;
e) the maximum reapplying time is 15 minutes.

<b>As an impromptu tourniquet, you can use improvised means:</b>
Braid, scarf, tie and other similar things. To stop bleeding in this case, a loop is made from these materials, twisting until the arterial bleeding stops or is significantly weakened using any durable object (metal or wooden rod). When the bleeding is stopped, the rod is bandaged to the limb. Improvised harnesses are also superimposed according to the rules described above.
  
<b>If the victim is conscious</b>
It is necessary to seat him with his head slightly tilted forward and pinch his nose in the area of the wings of the nose for 15-20 minutes. In this case, you can put cold on the bridge of your nose. If after the specified time the bleeding has not stopped, you should call an ambulance, until the arrival of which you must continue to perform the same measures.
  
<b>If the victim with a nosebleed is unconscious</b>
It should be given a stable lateral position, controlling the airway, call an ambulance.
