<b>Temporary stop of external bleeding in neck injuries</b>
Neck injuries can be life-threatening if there is damage to large vessels, especially the carotid arteries. In order to prevent the death of the victim, it is necessary to stop it immediately after detecting arterial bleeding.

The fastest way is to digitally press the carotid artery between the wound and the heart, performed on the front surface of the neck outside of the larynx towards the spine on the side of the injury with four fingers at the same time or with the thumb.

If it is difficult to determine the place of pressure, it is possible to use direct pressure on the wound.

In the presence of venous bleeding, a pressure bandage is used to stop it.

<b>Injury to the cervical spine</b>
A fairly serious injury is damage to the cervical spine, which can develop, for example, in a traffic accident (when hitting from behind or hitting an obstacle, a so-called “whiplash” injury can occur, leading to damage to the cervical vertebrae due to sharp extension or sharp bending of the neck) , falling from a height, diving, etc. With a cervical spine injury with spinal cord injury, the victim may be conscious, but completely or partially immobilized. Dislocations and fractures of the cervical vertebrae are manifested by a sharp pain in the neck. The victim can support his head with his hands, the neck muscles will be tense.

<b>Emergency Extract</b>
In case of emergency extraction of the victim, it is necessary to use the fixation of the neck by hand.

<b>Relocation of the victim</b>
When moving the victim, it is necessary to fix his head and neck manually with the forearms.

<b>Improvised means for fixing the cervical spine</b>
As improvised means for fixing the cervical spine, elements of clothing (a trigger, a sweater, etc.) can be used, which are wrapped around the neck, preventing compression of the soft tissues and organs of the neck, but ensuring that the edges of the improvised collar tightly support the head.

<b>The presence in the equipment of standard devices for fixing the cervical spine</b>
If the equipment includes standard devices for fixing the cervical spine (cervical collars, cervical splints), they must be used in accordance with their instructions for use. Such devices are superimposed together, while one of the first aid participants fixes the victim’s head and neck with his own hands, the assistant places the back of the collar on the back of the victim’s neck. After that, it bends the front part forward and fixes it (the method of fixation is determined by the design of the collar).

<b>First aid</b>
When providing first aid, it should be remembered that the displacement of damaged cervical vertebrae can lead to serious consequences, up to stopping breathing and blood circulation.

It is necessary to exclude additional trauma and the possibility of damage to the spinal cord when removing and moving the victim.
To do this, it is necessary to manually maintain the head in a position that restricts movement, waiting for the arrival of an ambulance.
