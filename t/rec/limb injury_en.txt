Injuries to the extremities are often accompanied by damage to blood vessels, so it is important to stop bleeding detected in a timely manner. To do this, all methods are used: direct pressure on the wound, the imposition of a pressure bandage, finger pressure on the artery, maximum flexion of the limb in the joint, the imposition of a hemostatic tourniquet.

Immobilization is the creation of immobility (rest) of a damaged body part with the help of improvised means, ready-made transport tires (medical products that are part of first aid kits) or using healthy parts of the victim's body (autoimmobilization).

If there is a suspicion of a bone injury, the person providing first aid should decide on the tactics of action in relation to the victim.
